\lettrine{L}{et} $R$ be the radius of the robot (which is circular).
Since STDR appears to be entirely deterministic and devoid of
measurement error (by default, anyways), there is no need for any
error terms.  Now, for each LIDAR ping $i$, let $r_i$ and $\theta_i$
be, respectively, the radius and angle of that ping.

We wish to ensure a clear tunnel ahead of the robot that is at least
as wide as the robot is, for at least $d=$ \verb|MIN_SAFE_DISTANCE| in
front.  This corresponds to the region
$\{(x,y) \ |\ x\in[0,d], y\in[-R,R]\}$ in the robot's rectilinear
coordinate system (where $+x$ is forwards).  If any laser endpoint is
in this region, we sound the alarm.  The $x$ and $y$ values of each
laser endpoint are computed from their given polar form, thus:

\begin{equation*}
  \begin{array}{rl}
    x_i &= r_i\times\cos(\theta_i) \\
    y_i &= r_i\times\sin(\theta_i) \\
  \end{array}
\end{equation*}

Note that, since the walls of the STDR map/arena/maze/thing appear to
be rather fuzzy, and since numerical integration (which is effectively
what reactive\_commander does) has errors, an error term has been
added to $R$ to avoid close calls.
