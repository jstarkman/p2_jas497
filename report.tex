Let $R$ be the radius of the robot (assumed circular).  Since STDR is
entirely deterministic and devoid of measurement error, there is no
need for any error terms.  Now, for each LIDAR ping $i$, let $r_i$ and
$\theta_i$ be, respectively, the radius and angle of that ping.

We wish to ensure a clear tunnel ahead of the robot that is at least
as wide as the robot is, for at least $d=$\verb|MIN_SAFE_DISTANCE| in
front.  This corresponds to the region $x\in[0,d], y\in[-R,R]$ in the
robot's coordinates ($+x$ is forwards).  If any point is in this
region, we sound the alarm.  The $x$ and $y$ values of each point are
computed thus:

\begin{equation*}
  \begin{tabular}{rl}
    x_i &= r_i\times\cos(\theta_i) \\
    y_i &= r_i\times\sin(\theta_i) \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{equation*}
